# About Linda

Linda is a Horticultural Sciences PhD student at the University of Florida. She graduated from UF in 2018 with a B.S. in Biology with a specialization in Biotechnology and chose to pursue her love for molecular biology. Her research projects involve improving cold tolerance in sweet corn through breeding and molecular techniques. She's passionate about sustainability and watching videos at 2X speed. She dabbles in graphic design and is always on hunt for the next great meme. You can sometimes find her hiking on the Appalachian trail, at a local burger joint (well-done, all the way), or avoiding her growing email inbox.
