# About Linda

Linda is a Horticultural Sciences graduate student in the University of Florida. She graduated from UF in 2018 with a B.S. in Biology and chose to pursue her love of plants. You can sometimes find her hiking on the Appalachian trails, at a local burger joint (well-done, all the way), or avoiding her growing inbox.
