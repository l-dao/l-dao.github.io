# About Linda

Linda is a Horticultural Sciences PhD student at the University of Florida. She graduated from UF in 2018 with a B.S. in Biology with a specialization in Biotechnology and chose to pursue her love of plants. She is passionate about graphic design and is always on hunt for the next great meme. You can sometimes find her hiking on the Appalachian mountains, at a local burger joint (well-done, all the way), or avoiding her growing email inbox.
