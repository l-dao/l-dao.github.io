# About Linda

Linda is a Horticultural Sciences graduate student at the University of Florida. She graduated from UF in 2018 with a B.S. in Biology with a specialization in Biotechnology and chose to pursue her love of plants. She is a lover of good design and is always on hunt for the next great meme. You can sometimes find her hiking on the Appalachian trails, at a local burger joint (well-done, all the way), or avoiding her growing email inbox.
